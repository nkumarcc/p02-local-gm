### Varying Datasets (3 points)

1. Compare the performance of mnist and fashion-mnist

![Question 1 Tensorboard Plot](/images/q1_blue_fmnist.png)
- **Blue is fMNIST**
- **Orange is MNIST**

MNIST reaches 97.27% validation accuracy whereas with the same settings Fashion MNIST reaches only 82.07%. This suggests that FMNIST is a more complex dataset than MNIST. Further confirming our point, the difference between training accuracies is close to the difference in validation accuracies (94.14% MNIST vs 79.69% fMNIST), which means the error is not coming from overfitting to the more complex dataset (not from variance), but our model's lack of flexibility for more complex data (from bias).

### Varying Hyperparameters (3 points each)

2. Train for twice as many epochs for both mnist and fashion_mnist.
    - [Fashion 10 epochs, MNIST 10 epochs, Fashion 20 epochs, MNIST 20 epochs]
    - How is this similar and different previous runs?

![Question 2 Tensorboard Plot](./images/q2_blue_fmnist.png)
- **Blue is fMNIST**
- **Orange is MNIST**

We see that if we run for more epochs the validation accuracy of MNIST reaches 98.32% (increase of 1%) and that of FMNIST reaches 85.37% (increase of 3%). The training accuracy of MNIST reaches 96.48% and of fMNIST reaches 83.59%, also showing increase. The loss also continues to decrease. This shows that our model hadn't converged yet (and might not have now) and that more training could help our model.

3. Change the SGD Learning Rate by a factor of
    - [0.1x, 1x, 10x]

![Question 3 Tensorboard Plot](./images/q3_pink_1_green_01_gray_001.png)
- **Pink is LR 10x**
- **Green is LR 1x**
- **Gray is LR 0.1x**

We see with a learning rate of 0.1x the decrease in loss happens slowly, whereas for with a learning rate of 10x it happens faster than 1x. Learning rate of 10x seems to be a better learning rate our accuracy touhces 87% compared to 1x where it only reaches 81%. Thus 10x learning rate helps us with faster convergence.

4. Compare Optimizers
    - [SGD, Adam, Rmsprop]

![Question 4 Tensorboard Plot](./images/q4_orange_sgd_blue_adam.png)
- **Blue is Adam**
- **Orange is SGD**
- **Red is Rmsprop**

RMSProp and SGD perform similarly. Adam outperforms both the other optimizers, since it also keeps record of exponentially decaying gradients average of past gradients, apart from storing just the exponentialy decaying average of past squared gradients. Adam reaches an accuracy of 88% compared to 83% and 82% for RMSProp and SGD respectively.

5. Set the dropout layer to a dropout rate of
    - [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.9, 1]

![Question 5 Tensorboard Plot](./images/q5_blue_0_25_pink_50_green_90_gray_100.png)
- **Blue is 0**
- **Blue is 0.25 (Tensorboard set both to the same color)**
- **Pink is 0.5**
- **Green is 0.9**
- **Gray is 1**

As we can expect a dropout of 1 means that a layer is always disabled, thus with a dropout of 1 our network performs as bad as a random classifier, with no decrease in loss.
We expect similar performance from a dropout rate of 0.9 where it will take much more epochs to learn anything substantial.
We observe that among 0.25 and 0.5 of dropout 82% and 80% respectively. With more epochs we can expect them to perform similarly. 

Also with higher dropout rates we observe similar accuracy on train and validation both, confirming that we are not overfitting.

6. Change the batch size by a factor of:
     - [1/8x, 1x, 8x]

![Question 6 Tensorboard Plot](./images/q6_grey_32_orange_256.png)
- **Grey is 1/8x Batch Size**
- **Orange is the default Batch Size**
- **Blue is 8x**

With a batch size of 8x we observe that our loss decreases sub-linearly, this indicates that our weight updates with respect to our gradients are much more informed compared to batch size of 1x or 1/8x, where the decrease is gradual. However with a batch size of 1/8x it means we are performing 8 times more updates to our weights, which leads to a faster convergence as our accuracy achieved is 88%. Whereas for a batch size of 1x and 1/8x our accuracies are 82% and 72% respectively. Running the latter batch sizes for longer epochs might lead to similar performance.

7. Change the number of output channels in each convolution and the first Linear layer.
    - [0.5x, 1x, 2x]
    - Note: The input values of each layer will need to match the previous layer.
    - You'll need to implement `P2Q7HalfChannelsNet` and `P2Q7DoubleChannelsNet`.

![Question 7 Tensorboard Plot](./images/q7_blue_half_pink_def_green_double.png)
- **Blue is half the channels**
- **Pink is default the channels**
- **Green is double the channels**


Here we have similar performance when our channels are 1x and 2x, with a performance of 82.05% and 82.92% accuracy. This indicates extracting more information from our linear layer will help us only marginally, although we may see this difference increase with more epochs. However with half as many channels our model gives 79% accuracy. This can be attributed to the fact that not enough information is being extracted from our input layers.

8. Add a Batch Normalization Layer after the first convolution.

![Question 8 Tensorboard Plot](./images/q8.png)
- **Red is after adding batchnormalization**

Adding batchnormalization improved performance, by preventing overfitting (imposing regularisation). We may see further effects with more epochs

9. Add a Dropout layer immediately after the Batch Normalization from the previous question.

Adding a dropout layer after batch norm reduced the performance. This could be attributed to slower learning due to dropout. However running for more epochs might help reducing overfitting.

10. Move the Batch Normalizaton layer just below the Dropout layer from the previous question.
    - Compare 9 with 10 and explain what happened.
    - You may want to do a quick search of the current literature for this one.

Swapping position of dropout layer hurt the performance. The paper by (Li. et al)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05134] explains the effect of having dropout before BN. 

From our understanding, we say that dropout shifts the variance of neural units when moving from train to test. Whereas BN maintains this statistical variance. This inconsistency of variance causes unstable behaviour in inference that leads to degraded performane. If we dropout some units before BN it would result in a different calculation of the mean and variance, whereas during test time we would have all units present. Hence it is safe to say that dropout after BN is preferred over dropout before BN.

11. Add one extra Conv2D layer

We added the extra Conv2D layer after our second convolution layer, thus expanding from 20 to 30 channels. We didn't use max pool. This deteriorated our performance with default settings. This is not abnormal, since we have a more complex model, and the number of epochs is the same as the less complex model. However we observe that loss is continuously decreasing, therefore training on more epochs would definitely help our case. 

12. Remove a layer of your choice
    - In addition to the standard questions, what did you choose and why?

We removed the FC2 from the model. Since we are dealing with images, removing a convolution would result in losing the shift invariance. Secondly, removing a fully connected layer also reduces the number of parameters significantly. So now our FC1 is of dimension **320 x 10**. 

This resulted in similar performance (84% on valdidation) and also the model was much faster to train.
